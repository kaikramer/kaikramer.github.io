<h2 class="h3 page-header">The 10th Anniversary of the First Open Source Release - 19 Oct 2023</h2>
<p>
    <p>Today we are celebrating a decade of KeyStore Explorer as open source software. On October 19, 2013 version 5.0.0 
      of KeyStore Explorer was released under the GPLv3 license on Sourceforge. </p>

    <p>The history of KSE up to this date and how it became open source was 
    documented by its creator Wayne in a very captivating manner in his blog. If you haven't read this story yet, here are 
    the links:</p>

    </p>
    <p>In those last 10 years more than 100 new features have been added in 18 releases. To name just a few of the most important ones:
    <ul>
      <li>Support for ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography), EdDSA (Ed25519 and Ed448) and RSASSA-PSS signatures</li>
      <li>Support for MSCAPI and PKCS#11, allowing the use of smart cards and HSMs with KSE</li>
      <li>System clipboard integration</li>
      <li>More CA features like extension templates, custom certificate extensions and CRL creation</li>
      <li>JWT (JSON Web Token) creation</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>Many of those features were user contributions. All in all almost 30 persons have contributed code or translations to
      this project and I want to thank all of them for making this project what it is today! The top 5 contributors are:

    </p>
    <p>There has been a constant rise in the user count over the last 10 years as well. In 2013, monthly downloads averaged
      1,500, but today, that figure has increased to around 35,000.</p>
    <p>What is planned for the future? KSE v5.6.0 will be the next big feature release, and it will focus on the following topics:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Improved PKCS#12 support</li>
      <li>Extended verification features (verifying signatures of jars and CSRs)</li>
      <li>Extended JWT support (for example key import/export in JWK format)</li>
    </ul>

<h2 class="h3 page-header">One Million Downloads - 14 Oct 2020</h2>
<p>
    Today KeyStore Explorer has crossed one million downloads on GitHub. <img src="images/party-popper-icon.png" alt=""
    height="24" width="24" style="vertical-align: baseline;"/>
    This includes all releases since November 2015. Not included are downloads from the time when KSE was hosted on
    Sourceforge (2013 - 2015) or when KSE was Closed Source (2004 - 2013). It took around three years to reach 500,000
    downloads and then only two more years for one million, which shows that the number of users is steadily increasing.
</p>
<p>
    If you are interested in a more detailed breakdown of the download numbers, there is a nice website called
