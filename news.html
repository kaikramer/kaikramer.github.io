<h2 class="h3 page-header">One Million Downloads - 14 Oct 2020</h2>
<p>
    Today KeyStore Explorer has crossed one million downloads on GitHub. <img src="images/party-popper-icon.png" alt=""
    height="24" width="24" style="vertical-align: baseline;"/>
    This includes all releases since November 2015. Not included are downloads from the time when KSE was hosted on
    Sourceforge (2013 - 2015) or when KSE was Closed Source (2004 - 2013). It took around three years to reach 500,000
    downloads and then only two more years for one million, which shows that the number of users is steadily increasing.
</p>
<p>
    If you are interested in a more detailed breakdown of the download numbers, there is a nice website called
