    <h1>Release 5.5.0 <small class="text-muted">XX Dec 2021</small></h1>
</div>
<p>
    This release includes the following new features, enhancements and bugfixes:
</p>


<h2 class="h3">CRL Signing</h2>
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-6">
        <p>
            Previous versions of KSE had some basic CA features like signing X.509
            certificates, key creation, PKCS#10 requests, support for many
            X.509 extensions, extension profiles, but revokating certificates
            by creating/signing a certificate revocation list (CRL) has been
            missing so far.
        </p>
        <p>
            This has changed in version 5.5.0. In the context menu of key
            pair entries is now a new item called "Sign CRL", which opens the
            dialog on the right.
        </p>
        <p>
            <img src="images/releases/rel55_sign_crl_menu.png" class="img" align="top" border="0" />
        </p>
        <p>
            Certificates can be added to the CRL in three ways:
            <ul>
                <li>By selecting a certificate from a keystore file.</li>
                <li>By selecting a certificate file.</li>
                <li>By selecting an older CRL from the same issuer certificate.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            The generated CRL can then be saved to the file system in PEM or DER format.
        </p>
        <p>
            The feature uses an automatically created file with the issuer serial number as its name and ".db" 
            as its extension to save meta data like CRL serial number, the revoked certificates and the validity 
            period. This makes creating subsequent CRLs much easier.
        </p>
        <p>

<h2 class="h3">Certificate Validation</h2>
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-6">
        <p>
            KSE can now do a certificate validation - including a check of the revocation status
            with four different methods.
        </p>

        </p>
    </div>
</div>

<h2 class="h3">EdDSA</h2>
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-6">
        <p>
            Support for the (twisted) Edwards curves has been added. This includes key
            generation and EdDSA signature scheme:
            <ul>
                <li>Ed25519</li>
                <li>Ed448</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Choosing an elliptic curve that is both secure and efficient has
            not been easy in the past. The Edwards curves are therefore a useful
            addition to KSE.
        </p>
    </div>

            <img src="images/releases/rel55_eddsa.png" class="img" align="top" border="0" />
        </p>
    </div>
</div>

<h2 class="h3">RSASSA-PSS</h2>
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-6">
        <p>
            In contrast to the older PKCS#1 v1.5 signature scheme the
            Probabilistic Signature Scheme (PSS) from PKCS#1 v2.1
            is provably secure. This does not mean that the v1.5 scheme is
            unsecure, but PSS should be preferred if possible.
        </p>
        <p>
            The PSS versions of the signature algorithms can be recognized by
            the appended "and MGF1":
            <ul>
                <li>SHA-1 with RSA and MGF1</li>
                <li>SHA-224 with RSA and MGF1</li>
                <li>SHA-256 with RSA and MGF1</li>
                <li>SHA-384 with RSA and MGF1</li>
                <li>SHA-512 with RSA and MGF1</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    </div>

        </p>
    </div>
</div>

<h2 class="h3">CRL Distribution Points Extension</h2>
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-6">
        <p>
            The CRL Distribution Points (CDP) extension is one of the standard certificate extensions
            from RFC 5280. With KSE being able to create CRLs, this extension is even more relevant now.
        </p>
        <p>
            The extension can contain multiple distribution points and every distribution point has three
            optional fields:
            <ul>
                <li>One or more "General Names" (usually an URL pointing to the current CRL)</li>
                <li>Reason Flags (for segmenting CRLs by reason code)</li>
                <li>CRL Issuer (the distinguished name from the issuer field of the CRL)</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            This feature was contributed by Jairo Graterón.

        </p>
    </div>
</div>

<h2 class="h3">Custom Certificate Extensions</h2>
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-6">
        <p>
            When generating a certificate with KSE, a wide range of commonly
            used certificate extensions can be added. There are however some
            exotic or non-public extensions that are completely out of
            scope for a tool like KSE. With this new feature any extension can
            be added to a new certificate by entering the object ID (OID) of
            the extension and the value as a hex encoded string.
        </p>
        <p>
            The value has to be entered as the hexadecimal encoding of the
            DER-encoded ASN.1 value of the extension without the encapsulating
            OCTET STRING tag and length bytes.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Examples:</b>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>
                    The "OCSP No Check" extension is one of the most simple
                    X.509 extensions because it has ASN.1 "NULL" as its
                    value. Just leave the input field for the extension empty
                    in this case.
                    <table class="table table-bordered">
                        <tr>
                            <th scoppe="row">Object ID</th>
                            <td>1.3.6.1.5.5.7.48.1.5</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <th scoppe="row">Value</th>
                            <td>(empty)</td>
                        </tr>
                    </table>
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    The old and obsolete Netscape extensions were removed in
                    KSE 5.5.0 but you can still add them as a custom extension.
                    The OID "2.16.840.1.113730.1.1" represents
                    netscape-cert-type and 03020410 is the hexadecimal encoding
                    of the DER-encoded ASN.1 value for type "Object Signing":
                    BIT STRING (tag "03") with length "02" bytes, 4 unused bits
                    ("04") and '10'H='00010000'B (bit 3 = Object Signing)
                    <table class="table table-bordered">
                        <tr>
                            <th scoppe="row">Object ID</th>
                            <td>2.16.840.1.113730.1.1</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <th scoppe="row">Value</th>
                            <td>03020410</td>
                        </tr>
                    </table>
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    More complex extensions are of course also possible, it is
                    only a matter of encoding the value correctly. For a CRL
                    Distribution Points extension with URL
                    "http://dodgycert.example.com/evca.crl" you would enter the
                    following OID and value:
                    <table class="table table-bordered">
                        <tr>
                            <th scoppe="row">Object ID</th>
                            <td>2.5.29.31</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <th scoppe="row">Value</th>
                            <td>302d302ba029a0278625687474703a2f2f646f64<br>
                                6779636572742e6578616d706c652e636f6d2f65<br>
                                7663612e63726c</td>
                        </tr>
                    </table>
                </p>

            </li>
        </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
            This is definitely a feature for advanced users who know what they are doing,
            but it has been repeatedly requested.

<h2 class="h3">Additional Name Components for Distinguished Names</h2>
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-6">
        <p>
            The distinguished name (DN) chooser/viewer dialog has been extended with seven additional
            name components:
            <ul>
                <li>Name (OID 2.5.4.41)</li>
                <li>Street (OID 2.5.4.9)</li>
                <li>Title (OID 2.5.4.12)</li>
                <li>Initials (OID 2.5.4.43)</li>
                <li>Pseudonym (OID 2.5.4.65)</li>
                <li>DN Qualifier (OID 2.5.4.46)</li>
                <li>Generation Qualifier (OID 2.5.4.44)</li>
            </ul>

<h2 class="h3">Sign Multiple Jars</h2>
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-6">
        <p>
            With KSE 5.5.0 it is now possible to sign multiple jar files at once.
        </p>
        <p>
            The browse button now opens a file chooser dialog that allows to select multiple files.
            Next to the button is an indicator showing the number of selected files.
        </p>
        <p>
            As before it is possible to either replace the original jar file with the signed one or
            create a new file. In the latter case the file name of the signed jar is created
            by adding a prefix and/or a suffix. The suffix is added <i>before</i> the file extension.

<h2 class="h3">Find KeyStore Entries</h2>
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-6">
        <p>
            You can now search the current keystore.
        </p>
        <p>
            The keyboard shortcut for "Examine File" (Ctrl-F) has been changed
            to Ctrl-E in KSE 5.5.0 so that the more intuitive Ctrl-F can be
            used for this new find feature.

        <p>
            Every keystore entry with a matching name is selected after the search was executed.
            The number of selected entries has been added to the status bar, which gives an overview
            of the search result, which is useful if not all found entries fit into the window.

        <p>
            Wherever in KSE where you can enter OIDs, this new feature makes suggestions
            that you can select from a drop down list. Of course - if none of the suggestions
            should match, you can still enter another OID just like before.

            This new feature allows to create a Diffie-Hellman (DH) key exchange parameters PEM file

        </p>
        <p>
            The Java implementation of the DH parameter generation is pretty slow, so especially for
            key sizes above 2048 OpenSSL is still the better tool for this task.

<h2 class="h3">New Windows Launcher ("kse.exe")</h2>
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-6">
        <p>
            KSE 5.5.0 comes with a completely new launcher executable for Windows. It was written 
            especially for KSE and uses <a href="https://github.com/Bill-Stewart/JavaInfo">Bill Stewart's JavaInfo.dll</a>
            for detecting Java installations.
        </p>
        <p>
            The launcher searches for Java in the following locations in exactly this order:
            <ol>
                <li>In a folder named "jre" next to kse.exe.</li>
                <li>In the paths where the environment variables JAVA_HOME, JDK_HOME and JRE_HOME point to.</li>
                <li>In the folders of the Path environment variable if there is a java.exe.</li>
                <li>The registry in the following locations:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\JavaSoft</li>

    <div class="col-md-6">
        <p>
            The Windows installer for KSE is now made with InnoSetup and comes with the following improvements:
            <ul>
                <li>HKLM\SOFTWARE\Classes or HKCU\Software\Classes are used instead of HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT</li>
                <li>kse.exe is added to "Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\App Paths"</li>
                <li>A ProgId is created for selected file types</li>
                <li>Values to OpenWithProgIds subkey are added for selected file types</li>
                <li>Localization: You can choose your language for the installation (currently English and German)</li>
                <li>Detection of a currently running KSE process</li>
            </ul>
            Also, there are two versions of the Windows installer now:
            <ul>
                <li><b>kse-550-setup.exe</b>: This is the recommended version. It includes a custom, size optimized Java runtime (27 MB vs 160 MB).</li>
                <li><b>kse-550-setup-no-jre.exe</b>: This version is for those users who want to use a specific Java runtime with KSE.</li>
            </ul>
