        <h5 class="h5">Improvements</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Comparing certificates - two ways to compare certificates have been added:</li>
            <ol>
                <li>Side-by-side textual comparison: By selecting two certificates in the main view and choosing "Compare" in the
                    context menu, a summary of the most important certificate data and an ASN.1 dump of both certificates
                    is displayed side by side and the differences are marked in a contrasting color (contributed by Jairo Graterón).
                </li>
                <li>Multiple certificate view dialogs: The certificate viewer dialog is now non-modal, which means several instances
                    of this dialog can be kept open at the same time. This allows to view multiple certificates at the same time
                    (contributed by Piotr Kubiak).</li>
            </ol>
            <li>Added new configuration options:
                <ul>
                    <li>Size of generated certificate serial number (contributed by dedabob)</li>
                    <li>FlatLaf macOS themes</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Added functionality to examine JWT in system clipboard (contributed by Afonso Fernandes)</li>
            <li>Added PBES2 algorithms as encryption options for PKCS#8 export of private keys:
                <ul>
                    <li>PBES2 with SHA-1 and TDES</li>
                    <li>PBES2 with SHA-1 and AES-128</li>
                    <li>PBES2 with SHA-1 and AES-256</li>
                    <li>PBES2 with SHA-256 and AES-256</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Added export button in private key view dialog (contributed by Jairo Graterón)</li>
            <li>Added verify button in the CSR view dialog to check its signature</li>
            <li>Added start of certificate validity as additional optional column for main table view (contributed by Björn Michael)</li>
            <li>Improved certificate key usage and EKU dialogs by adding tooltips with additional details (contributed by The-Lum):
                <ul>
                    <li>For the key usage extension the number of the bit (for example 0 for digitalSignature)</li>
                    <li>For extended key usage the OID of the key usage</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Enlarged default size of ASN.1 dump window, hex dumps are now displayed in two columns of 8 bytes instead of one
                (contributed by The-Lum)</li>
            <li>Added total number of revoked certs to CRL view</li>
            <li>Added length info to OCTETSTRING and BITSTRING in ASN1 viewer</li>
            <li>HTTP redirects for downloads of CRLs and CRTs are now supported (contributed by Jairo Graterón)</li>
            <li>Made several adjustments to file extensions used as filters in file chooser dialogs and as default extensions for
                export files. The reasons were to adapt to existing official standards and also to avoid conflicts with other file
                types (thanks to Sergey Ponomarev for his investigations):
                <ul>
                    <li>Changed default file extension for <i>private key export as DER-encoded PKCS#8</i> from ".pkcs8" to ".p8" as
                        this extension was registered with IANA (contributed by Sergey Ponomarev)</li>
                    <li>Changed default file extension for <i>private key export as DER-encoded PKCS#1/ECPrivateKey</i> from ".key"
                        to ".privkey" (".key" is used for PGP/GPG files and also for Keynote presentations and there seems to be no
                        "official" file extension for these formats)</li>
                    <li>Changed default file extension for <i>public key export as DER-encoded RFC 5280 SubjectPublicKeyInfo</i>
                        from ".pub" to ".pubkey" (".pub" is used for MS Publisher files)</li>
                    <li>Changed default file extension for <i>PEM-encoded files</i> to ".pem" (usually in combination with a prefix
                        for the actual content like ".p8.pem" or ".pubkey.pem)"</li>
                    <li>Added ".p8", ".p8e" and ".pk8" as file extension filters for selecting / importing PKCS#8 files (contributed
                        by Sergey Ponomarev)</li>
                    <li>Added ".pem" as file extension filter to all file chooser dialogs that could possibly open PEM files</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Changed dialogs for key pair generation and signing CSRs to display serial number as hex string</li>
            <li>Improved certificate chain detection</li>
            <li>Adjusted password quality meter to show more realistic results</li>
            <li>Replaced IdenTrust's TSA with QuoVadis'</li>
            <li>Improved handling of invalid PEM files</li>
            <li>The certificates selection dialog is now resizable</li>
            <li>Fixed typo in tooltips for public key fingerprint</li>
            <li>Improved French translation (by The-Lum)</li>
            <li>Improved German translation</li>
            <li>Updated third-party libraries to latest versions, BC is now at version 1.77</li>
        </ul>
        <h5 class="h5">Bug Fixes</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Fixed handling of GeneralName/OtherName/UPN (reported by Björn Michael)</li>
            <li>Fixed handling of explicitly specified EC curve parameters (reported by Arnieh)</li>
            <li>Fixed calender selection issue in certificate generation dialog (reported by freedom1b2830)</li>

        <h5 class="h5">UI Improvements</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Improvements in public key details dialog:</li>
            <ol>
                <li>Added public key fingerprint with four algorithms:</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>RFC 5280 SubjectKeyIdentifier (SKI) method 1</li>
                    <li>RFC 5280 SubjectKeyIdentifier (SKI) method 2</li>
                    <li>SHA-1 calculated over SubjectPublicKeyInfo ASN.1 structure</li>
                    <li>SHA-256 calculated over SubjectPublicKeyInfo ASN.1 structure</li>
                </ol>
                <li>Improved detail infos for EC keys (showing the named curve and public key fields)</li>
            </ol>
            <li>Redesigned Preferences dialog (contributed by Colbix)</li>
            <li>Added a setting for PKCS#12 encryption to preferences. This allows to use a less secure encryption algorithm and is
                basically a workaround for Windows Server 2016
                which does not support PBES2 with AES256, which is the standard encryption for PKCS#12 files in newer Java versions.
                This has no effect if the Java runtime still uses the old encryption algorithm.
            </li>
            <li>Added "eye" (reveal) button on password fields (this works only with look&amp;feel set to "Flat Light", "Flat Dark", "Flat IntelliJ" or "Flat Darcula")</li>
            <li>Generate Certificate: New button "Transfer Name and Extensions" was added that allows to select an existing
                certificate as a template for the new one (contributed by Jairo Graterón)</li>
            <li>List certificates dialog was improved, it reflects the main table now (contributed by Jairo Graterón)</li>
            <li>The icons for expiry status in the main table do not only differ in color now but also
                in shape and symbols, making it easier for users with color deficiencies to differentiate between them.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h5 class="h5">Other Improvements</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Added support for Base64 encoded DER keys/CSRs in "Examine File/Clipboard" (in addition to PEM and binary DER)</li>
            <li>Added support for DN attribute "organizationIdentifier" 2.5.4.97</li>
            <li>Updated JavaFXFileChooser to include setSelectedExtensionFilter (contributed by Colbix)</li>
            <li>Updated DErrorCollection (contributed by Colbix)</li>
            <li>Generated CSRs are now also copied to system clipboard</li>
            <li>Improved focus order in DN chooser: You can now use the tab key to go to the next input field.</li>
            <li>TSA list: Added timestamp.identrust.com (replacing tsa.starfieldtech.com)</li>
            <li>Updated libraries to latest versions, BC is now at version 1.72</li>
        </ul>
        <h5 class="h5">Removals</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Removed support for obsolete BKS-V1 keystore type</li>
            <li>Removed obsolete hash algorithms: MD2, MD4, RIPEMD128, RIPEMD256</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
        <h5 class="h5">Bug Fixes</h5>

            <li>Fixed parsing of MsCrlNextPublish extension (reported by The-Lum)</li>
            <li>Fixed UI freeze on auto update check when packets are dropped (reported by SanskritFritz)</li>
            <li>PAC: included standalone Nashorn; replaced pac JS with Java code (reported by poel)</li>
            <li>Fixed top left icon for ASN.1 dump window (reported by The-Lum)</li>
            <li>Fixed detection of local JRE (reported by FranLa and Tabiskabis)</li>

<div class="page-header">
    <h1>Release 5.5.0 <small class="text-muted">5 Dec 2021</small></h1>
</div>
<p>
    This release includes the following new features, enhancements and bugfixes:
</p>


<h2 class="h3">CRL Signing</h2>
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-6">
        <p>
            Previous versions of KSE had some basic CA features like signing X.509
            certificates, key creation, PKCS#10 requests, support for many
            X.509 extensions, extension profiles, but revokating certificates
            by creating/signing a certificate revocation list (CRL) has been
            missing so far.
        </p>
        <p>
            This has changed in version 5.5.0. In the context menu of key
            pair entries is now a new item called "Sign CRL", which opens the
            dialog on the right.
        </p>
        <p>
            <img src="images/releases/rel55_sign_crl_menu.png" class="img" align="top" border="0" />
        </p>
        <p>
            Certificates can be added to the CRL in three ways:
            <ul>
                <li>By selecting a certificate from a keystore file.</li>
                <li>By selecting a certificate file.</li>
                <li>By selecting an older CRL from the same issuer certificate.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            The generated CRL can then be saved to the file system in PEM or DER format.
        </p>
        <p>
            The feature uses an automatically created file with the issuer serial number as its name and ".db"
            as its extension to save meta data like CRL serial number, the revoked certificates and the validity
            period. This makes creating subsequent CRLs much easier.
        </p>
        <p>
            This feature was contributed by Jairo Graterón.
        </p>

        </p>
    </div>

<h2 class="h3">Certificate Validation</h2>
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-6">
        <p>
            KSE can now do a certificate validation - including a check of the revocation status
            with four different methods.
        </p>
        <p>

        <p>
            This feature was contributed by Jairo Graterón.

    <div class="col-md-6">
        <p>
            <img src="images/releases/rel55_verify_cert_dialog.png" class="img" align="top" border="0" />
        </p>
    </div>
</div>

<h2 class="h3">EdDSA</h2>
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-6">
        <p>
            Support for the (twisted) Edwards curves has been added. This includes key
            generation and EdDSA signature scheme:
            <ul>
                <li>Ed25519</li>
                <li>Ed448</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Choosing an elliptic curve that is both secure and efficient has
            not been easy in the past. The Edwards curves are therefore a useful
            addition to KSE.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-3">
        <p>
            <img src="images/releases/rel55_eddsa.png" class="img" align="top" border="0" />
        </p>
    </div>
</div>

<h2 class="h3">RSASSA-PSS</h2>
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-6">
        <p>
            In contrast to the older PKCS#1 v1.5 signature scheme the
            Probabilistic Signature Scheme (PSS) from PKCS#1 v2.1
            is provably secure. This does not mean that the v1.5 scheme is
            unsecure, but PSS should be preferred if possible.
        </p>
        <p>
            The PSS versions of the signature algorithms can be recognized by
            the appended "and MGF1":
            <ul>
                <li>SHA-1 with RSA and MGF1</li>
                <li>SHA-224 with RSA and MGF1</li>
                <li>SHA-256 with RSA and MGF1</li>
                <li>SHA-384 with RSA and MGF1</li>
                <li>SHA-512 with RSA and MGF1</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-3">

            <img src="images/releases/rel55_pss.png" class="img" align="top" border="0" />
        </p>
    </div>
</div>

<h2 class="h3">CRL Distribution Points Extension</h2>
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-6">
        <p>
            The CRL Distribution Points (CDP) extension is one of the standard certificate extensions
            from RFC 5280. With KSE being able to create CRLs, this extension is even more relevant now.
        </p>
        <p>
            The extension can contain multiple distribution points and every distribution point has three
            optional fields:
            <ul>
                <li>One or more "General Names" (usually an URL pointing to the current CRL)</li>
                <li>Reason Flags (for segmenting CRLs by reason code)</li>
                <li>CRL Issuer (the distinguished name from the issuer field of the CRL)</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            This feature was contributed by Jairo Graterón.

<h2 class="h3">Custom Certificate Extensions</h2>
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-6">
        <p>
            When generating a certificate with KSE, a wide range of commonly
            used certificate extensions can be added. There are however some
            exotic or non-public extensions that are completely out of
            scope for a tool like KSE. With this new feature any extension can
            be added to a new certificate by entering the object ID (OID) of
            the extension and the value as a hex encoded string.
        </p>
        <p>
            The value has to be entered as the hexadecimal encoding of the
            DER-encoded ASN.1 value of the extension without the encapsulating
            OCTET STRING tag and length bytes.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Examples:</b>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>
                    The "OCSP No Check" extension is one of the most simple
                    X.509 extensions because it has ASN.1 "NULL" as its
                    value. Just leave the input field for the extension empty
                    in this case.

                    The old and obsolete Netscape extensions were removed in
                    KSE 5.5.0 but you can still add them as a custom extension.
                    The OID "2.16.840.1.113730.1.1" represents
                    netscape-cert-type and 03020410 is the hexadecimal encoding
                    of the DER-encoded ASN.1 value for type "Object Signing":
                    BIT STRING (tag "03") with length "02" bytes, 4 unused bits
                    ("04") and '10'H='00010000'B (bit 3 = Object Signing)
                    <table class="table table-bordered">
                        <tr>
                            <th scoppe="row">Object ID</th>
                            <td>2.16.840.1.113730.1.1</td>

                <p>
                    More complex extensions are of course also possible, it is
                    only a matter of encoding the value correctly. For a CRL
                    Distribution Points extension with URL
                    "http://dodgycert.example.com/evca.crl" you would enter the
                    following OID and value:

                        <tr>

            With KSE 5.5.0 it is now possible to sign multiple jar files at once.
        </p>
        <p>
            The browse button now opens a file chooser dialog that allows to select multiple files.
            Next to the button is an indicator showing the number of selected files.
        </p>
        <p>
            As before it is possible to either replace the original jar file with the signed one or
            create a new file. In the latter case the file name of the signed jar is created
            by adding a prefix and/or a suffix. The suffix is added <i>before</i> the file extension.

            The keyboard shortcut for "Examine File" (Ctrl-F) has been changed
            to Ctrl-E in KSE 5.5.0 so that the more intuitive Ctrl-F can be
            used for this new find feature.

            Every keystore entry with a matching name is selected after the search was executed.
            The number of selected entries has been added to the status bar, which gives an overview
            of the search result, which is useful if not all found entries fit into the window.
