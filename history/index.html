<h2>A History of KeyStore Explorer – Part One (2011-12-22)</h2>

<p>
KeyStore Explorer (KSE) has existed, in one form or another, since
2002. These days it is a freeware offering but it has not always been
that way. KSE started as an open source project before morphing into a
commercial project. It is only relatively recently that it was
re-licensed to be free for all to use once again. As the utility is now
almost ten years old I feel it is a good time to write a potted history
of KSE.
</p>

<h3>Inception</h3>
<p>
Back in mid-2001 I was a relatively green programmer with only four
years of industry experience, mostly in C/C++ and RDBMS. I had just
joined an ISV in Glasgow to cross-train as a Java developer. Many things
interested me about the language notably its simplicity when compared to
C++, the principle of Write Once Run Anywhere (WORA) and the
cross-platform GUI toolkit: Swing.
</p>
<p>
(WORA and Swing are much maligned but not by me. If you put in the
effort into each you can reap the benefits. I may dip into these topics
in later postings).
</p>
<p>
All was well in my world. My employer looked to be going places, the
fallout from the Dot Com bubble hadn’t yet bitten and I was working with
interesting technology. However, to get the full benefit of working with
Java and Swing what I really needed was a side-project, something
outside of work where I would be free to develop as a chose, free from
interference. As a bonus it would be great if the side-project was
something new. The last thing I wanted to do was write yet another text
editor or world clock, something that had been done a hundred times
before.
</p>
<p>
It was then, in the course of my day job, that I came across keytool.
What keytool did intrigued me as I had no previous exposure to
Cryptography. How it presented itself, on the other hand, with its ugly
command-line interface provided me with an opportunity. I decided I
would use Swing to recreate keytool in the form of a friendly GUI. I did
some research and discovered that nobody had yet written a decent GUI
alternative for keytool. I had found my side-project.
</p>
<p>
Thanks to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/">Way Back Machine</a>
I have been able to retrieve my exact thoughts at the time. Back then I
wrote on the original tool’s website under the heading of “Why
Bother”:
</p>

<blockquote class="px-5 font-italic">
<p>
“As mentioned above Sun already supply keytool with the Java SDK and
the KeyTool GUI is just a GUI implementation of (approximately) the same
functionality. So why bother?
</p>
<p>
I found keytool to be a bugger to use with it’s many and various
options. Command-line tools are, after all, invariably harder to use
than equivalent GUIs. Secondly keytool forces its users to type in
keystore and protected entry passwords in the clear on the command-line.
This, of course, defeats the whole purpose of protecting keys in a
keystore in the first place! Thirdly I needed a wee project to get me up
and running using Swing.
</p>
So in an attempt to create an alternative to the command-line keytool
utility (and get some practise with Swing) I’ve put together the KeyTool
GUI.”
</blockquote>

<h3>KeyTool GUI</h3>
<p>

So KeyTool GUI (KTG) was born with the aim for the application being
that it not be “a bugger to use”. At first progress was slow as
everything was new to me. My Java experience was limited, as was my
exposure to GUI programming and UI design and I knew next to nothing
about cryptography or PKI. However, it was great fun developing all
these new skills. My core Java skills improved far more rapidly than
they would have done through my day job alone. I also greatly improved
as a UI designer by learning as much as I could from existing
applications and various publications. However, what turned out to most
challenging was the world of cryptography and PKI. Fortunately with the
aid of many books and the Java Cryptography Extensions (JCE) and the
Bouncy castle JCE provider I was able to progress in this area
rapidly.
</p>
<p>
Early on I decided to open source my efforts so that others could
benefit from my work. I settled on the GPL without too much thought. The
idea of open source was new to me too and it struck me as being the most
popular license at the time.
</p>
<p>
I worked for a year to produce version 1.0 releasing alpha and beta
candidates during this time. When released in April 2002 version 1.0 was
fairly feature rich allowing users to utilise a UI to create, modify and
save JKS KeyStores. They could also generate RSA and DSA key pairs,
import trusted certificates, create CSRs, import CA Replies and delete
and rename KeyStore entries. In other words, the core functionality of
keytool.
</p>
<p>
Over the next 20 months six more versions were released culminating
in version 1.7 in January 2004. Many additions were made during this
time including extending KeyStore support to include the JCEKS, PKCS
#12, BKS and UBER types, the ability to examine Certificates and CRLs,
CA Certificates support, PKCS #12 key pair import, a Windows installer
as well as many usability improvements.
</p>
<p>
By version 1.7 KTG could be described as a complete replacement for
keytool. However, there was still plenty of room for improvement so I
planned to release more versions. After all there was no reason to be
limited to simply imitating what keytool could do. Some of the
improvements planned included converting the single document interface
to support multiple files, to extend support to include more crypto
algorithms and file formats and to create installers for other platforms
like Mac OSX and Linux.
</p>

Also, despite effort being lavished on making the UI easy to use, it was
still a bit ugly, especially in the icon department. The icons were
those provided by Sun’s look and feel guide for Swing and some I had
cobbled together myself. I had no idea how I could source high quality
icons but I was determined to improve what was in KTG at the time.
However, I still like the splash screen that I put together for KTG
which featured my own set of key ring. In fact I still use the swiss
army knife featured on the splash screen above.
</p>
<p>
Regardless of its limitations the tool was proving popular with over
2,000 downloads a month and I received overwhelmingly positive feedback
from users. This helped spur me to carry on development.
</p>
<p>
In early 2004 I was working on KTG 1.8. Despite this version 1.7
proved to be the last version of KTG released as 1.8 never saw the light
of day. I will detail why KTG was abandoned when I continue this history
in <a href="#a-history-of-keystore-explorer-part-two-2012-02-21">part
two</a>.
