    <h1>Release 5.6.0 <small class="text-muted">17 May 2025</small></h1>
</div>
<p>
    This release includes the following new features, enhancements, translations and bugfixes:
</p>

<h2 class="h3">KeyStore Password Manager</h2>
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-6">
        <p>
            The KeyStore password manager is a new feature that allows to store and manage passwords for keystore files.
            In combination with the new password generator it is now very easy to create and open keystores without
            having to type long passwords.
        </p>
        <p>
            The password manager can be used by selecting the checkbox "Store this keystore's passwords in KSE's password
            manager" when creating a new keystore or opening an existing one. This decision is on a per-keystore basis
            and it includes all passwords of this keystore, but it can be changed later.
        </p>
        <p>
            On the first use of the password manager, a global password for the password manager must be set.
            This password is used to encrypt the passwords stored in the password manager.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the preferences dialog a new section has been added for the configuration of both the password manager
            and the password generator.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the next releases, more configuration options for the password manager will be added.
        </p>
        <p>
            Details about the password manager can be found in the <a href="doc/5.6/passwordManager.html">documentation</a>.

<h2 class="h3">Key Export in JWK Format</h2>
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-6">
        <p>
            The JSON Web Key (JWK) format is a JSON representation of cryptographic keys. It is defined in
            RFC 7517 and is used in many modern web applications.
            </p>
        <p>
            KSE can now export public and private keys in JWK format. Supported are currently RSA and EC keys (no Ed25519).

<h2 class="h3">Verification of JWT Signatures</h2>
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-6">
        <p>
            In one of the last releases, KSE introduced a viewer for JWT (JSON Web Token) files, which can be used via the
            "Examine File" or "Examine Clipboard" menu items.
        </p>
        <p>
            This JWT viewer can now
            also verify the signatures of JWT files. This is done by pasting a public key in encoded as PEM or Base64 DER
            into the public key field of the JWT viewer and then clicking the verify button.
            Supported are RSA and EC keys and the corresponding signature algorithms ("RS...", "ES..." and "PS...").
        </p>
        <p>
            This feature was contributed by Jairo Graterón.

<h2 class="h3">File signing and verification using PKCS#7/CMS</h2>
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-6">
        <p>
            KSE now supports signing and verifying arbitrary files using PKCS#7/CMS. This is a widely used standard for
            signing files.
        </p>
        <p>
            This feature can be found in the context menu of key pair entries:
        </p>
        <p>
            <img src="images/releases/release560/p7_sign_menu.png" class="img" alt="screenshot of pkcs7 sign menu" />
        </p>
        <p>
            The PKCS#7 file can be either stored separately as a so-called "detached signature" or the signed file can be
            embedded in the PKCS#7 file. The latter is called "enveloped signature". In both cases the output format
            can be either PEM or binary DER.
        </p>
        <p>
            A TSA (timestamp authority) can be used to timestamp the signature. KSE includes a list of well-known TSAs
            that can be used for this purpose. If you want to use another TSA, then its URL can be entered manually instead.
        </p>
        <p>
            And finally the signature can be added as a "counter signature" to an existing PKCS#7 file. A counter
            signature does not sign data but another signature.

<h2 class="h3">Native File Chooser</h2>
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-6">
        <p>
            This is not really a new feature, but so far there have been several restrictions that prevented the native
            file chooser to be available in KSE for a majority of the users.
            First of all the Java runtime had to include the JavaFX library, which is not the
            case anymore for most modern Java distributions.
            Also, on macOS the native file chooser had to be disabled because
            of an incompatibility between tools like Karabiner or Cinch and the JavaFX library. This seems to be fixed now.
        </p>
        <p>
            Starting with this release KSE includes the JavaFX library and the native file chooser can be enabled
            in the preferences.
        </p>

<h2 class="h3">New PKCS#12 Features</h2>
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-6">
        <p>
            PKCS#12 is a very flexible format. It can contain an arbitrary number of key pairs, certificates and even
            <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7292#section-4.2.4">CRLs</a>. A wide range of
            encryption algorithms can be used to protect the contents of a PKCS#12 file.
        </p>
        <p>
            With this flexibility comes complexity. There have always been compatibility issues with PKCS#12 files
            created by different tools. This situation has not exactly improved when Java 8 introduced support for
            so-called "trusted certificates" (i.e. standalone certificates that are not associated with a key in the
            same file) in PKCS#12 files by marking them with a custom bag attribute with OID "2.16.840.1.113894.746875.1.1".
        </p>
        <p>
            As a result any certificate in a PKCS#12 file that is not part of the chain belonging to a key in the same
            file is simply ignored by the Java runtime. This has caused a lot of confusion among users.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the meantime OpenSSL v3.2 has added a new flag "<b>-jdktrust anyExtendedKeyUsage</b>" to its pkcs12
            command that allows to create PKCS#12 files with standalone certificates that are compatible with Java:
        <pre>
$ openssl pkcs12 \
        -export \
        -out test.p12 \
        -in test.cer \
        -jdktrust anyExtendedKeyUsage

$ keytool -list -keystore test.p12
Enter keystore password:
Keystore type: PKCS12
Keystore provider: SUN

Your keystore contains 1 entry

1, Jan 28, 2024, trustedCertEntry,
Certificate fingerprint (SHA-256): 52:68:B6:49:C9:8B:16:...
            </pre>
        </p>
    </div>
</div>
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-6">
        <h3 class="h5">PKCS#12 Content Viewer</h3>
        <p>
            With OpenSSL, keytool and KSE being able to create and read PKCS#12 files with trusted certificates, there
            a few use cases left where KSE is not able to read certificates in PKCS#12 files created by other tools.
        </p>
        <p>
            The new PKCS#12 viewer can be used to inspect the contents and structure of PKCS#12 files and help identify
            possible issues. The viewer can be opened via the "Examine File" or "Examine Clipboard" menu items.
            Also drag and drop of PKCS#12 files or opening them by double-clicking them in the file manager will
            open the PKCS#12 viewer first.
        </p>
        <p>
            The p12 viewer shows the contents and structure of the PKCS#12 file in a tree view. The details of each
            entry can be viewed by expanding it in the tree view. The details include the type of the entry,
            the algorithm used to encrypt it and the parameters. Keys and certificates are not included, just some
            information like subject/issuer and serial number to identify them.
        </p>
        <p>
            For p12 files that cause issues in KSE, the viewer might help to identify the cause of the problem. There is
            a "Copy" button that copies the visible structure as text to the clipboard. This then can be pasted into a
            GitHub issue to provide the developers with the necessary information to analyse the issue.
        </p>
        <p>
            After inspecting the contents of the PKCS#12 file, it can be opened in KSE by clicking the "Open" button.
        </p>
        <p>
            This feature is only temporary and will either be completely removed, reworked or moved to a less prominent
            place.
            But right now PKCS#12 is a very important topic and the viewer should help a lot with it.

        <h3 class="h5">Reworked Encryption Settings for PKCS#12</h3>
        <p>
            The encryption settings for PKCS#12 files introduced in KSE v5.5.2 have been reworked. The previous
            implementation in some cases required a restart of KSE to take effect. The new implementation
            works reliably without a restart. Note that this setting is only used when creating a new PKCS#12 file.

        <h3 class="h5">Same Password for Whole PKCS#12 Content</h3>
        <p>
            Internally PKCS#12 files consist of "bags" that contain certificates or keys. Each key bag can be encrypted
            with a different password.
            This matches the KeyStore API which allows to use different passwords for each entry in a KeyStore.
            However, the widely established convention is to use the same password for all bags in a PKCS#12 file.
        </p>
        <p>
            KSE now uses the same password for all entries when a PKCS#12 keystore is created or modified. When a PKCS#12
            keystore is opened, KSE will try to use the keystore password for all entries. Only if this fails, KSE will
            ask for an entry password.
        </p>
    </div>
</div>


<h2 class="h3">New Configuration System</h2>
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-6">
        <p>
            In previous releases KSE used the Java Preferences API to store its configuration. This API is not
            very flexible and has some limitations. For example, it is difficult to store complex configuration objects.
            Also, the
            location of the configuration differs from platform to platform. On Windows it is stored in the registry,
            on macOS in a plist file and on Linux in a hidden directory in the home folder.
            This makes it difficult to share the configuration between different platforms or add a portable mode
            to KSE where the configuration files are stored in the same directory as KSE.
        </p>
        <p>
            KSE now uses a custom configuration system that stores the configuration always in a file and searches for
            it in the following locations in this order:
            <ol>
                <li>If a environment variable "<b>KSE_CONFIG_DIR</b>" is set, then this path is used.</li>
                <li>In the same directory as the KSE program files (kse.jar etc.)</li>
                <li>In a OS-specific configuration folder:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Windows: <b>%APPDATA%/kse/</b></li>
                    <li>Linux and macOS: <b>~/.config/kse/</b></li>
                </ul>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
            The configuration is stored in a JSON file called "<b>config.json</b>".
            The configuration file is created automatically after KSE was used for the first time.
        </p>
        <p>
            The encrypted passwords of the password manager are stored in a separate file called
            "<b>keystore-passwords.json</b>". This file is stored in the same directory as the main configuration file.
        </p>
        <p>
            The configuration file also includes now a section for system properties. This allows to set system properties
            like "sun.java2d.d3d.onscreen", which fixes a rare redraw issue on Windows. There is currently no GUI for
            this, because it is only needed for very special use cases.
        </p>
        <p>
            There is no automatic migration of the old configuration to the new one.

                <li>macOS: Added native package for Apple Silicon (partially contributed by jonwltn)</li>
                <li>macOS: The Vaqua theme is not included in this release because of changes in Apple's
                notarization process: If jar files contain native libraries, these must be signed with an Apple developer
                    certificate which is not the case for the Vaqua theme. If a solution is found for this problem,
                    Vaqua will be included again in a future release of KSE.</li>
                <li>Linux: Added more MIME types to the kse.desktop files (contributed by Sergey Ponomarev)</li>

                <li>macOS/Windows: Upgraded included Java runtime to version 21</li>
